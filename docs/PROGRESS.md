## 2026-05-02 - Durable Handoff

This file is a durable handoff summary, not a per-poll CI/Copilot log. Detailed PR iteration history belongs in the relevant GitHub PR.

Known workstreams:

| Workstream | Durable state |
| --- | --- |
| Macro Task 0 - durable agent operating system | Completed after merge of the macro PR to `main`. |
| Macro Task 1 - baseline tooling and Laravel 13 policy | Completed after merge of the macro PR to `main`; Composer/CI/docs now narrow to Laravel 13, PHP 8.3/8.4, and Composer-script quality gates. |
| Macro Task 2 - v0.2 persistence layer | In progress; persistence foundation is landing for storage contracts, schema, repositories, immutable run identity updates, timestamped atomic step upserts, append-only audit records, and payload redaction. |

Concurrent subtasks should add rows here instead of replacing existing workstreams.

To resume live work:

- Run `git status --short --branch`.
- Run `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,url`.
- For any active PR, verify head, reviewer, mergeability, and CI with `gh pr view <PR> --json headRefOid,mergeable,statusCheckRollup,reviewDecision,reviews`.
- Use `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR>/requested_reviewers`, or derive `<owner>/<repo>` with `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner`.

Completed in Macro Task 0:

- Added durable restart files: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/RULES.md`, `docs/LESSON.md`, `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/ENTERPRISE_PLAN.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.claude/skills/laravel-flow-enterprise/SKILL.md`, and `.claude/rules/rule-laravel-flow-enterprise.md`.
- Imported/adapted useful Padosoft Claude pack guidance from the reference project without copying app-specific implementation rules.
- Updated CI so PRs targeting `main` or `task/**` run the matrix; push-trigger CI remains limited to `main` to avoid duplicate subtask runs.
- Recorded the durable rule that README section `Comparison vs alternatives` must be reviewed for every new or materially improved feature, with competitor research when claims are uncertain.
- Aligned README, CONTRIBUTING, PR template, Copilot instructions, repo rules, and repo skills around the macro/subtask workflow, the pre-Macro-1 Laravel 12/13 compatibility state, companion-dashboard scope, and mandatory Copilot review.

Validation summary:

- Macro Task 0 was validated with:
  - `composer validate --strict --no-check-publish`
  - `vendor/bin/pint --test`
  - `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --no-progress`
  - `vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Unit` => 32 tests, 97 assertions
  - `vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Architecture` => 2 tests, 7 assertions

Next active macro:

- Continue Macro Task 2 from `docs/ENTERPRISE_PLAN.md`: v0.2 persistence layer on branch `task/v02-persistence`.
